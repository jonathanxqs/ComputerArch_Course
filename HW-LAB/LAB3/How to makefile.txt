Just as normal , I use the -O2 options to make the compiled codes more efficient

type 'make' in local dir
and then run the MIPS file 


-----------------

Name your zip folder yournetid_partnersnetid 
Inside your zip only have your cpp or header files and PDF file with the analysis plot
Your code should compile using g++ branchsimulator.cpp -o branchsimulator.out
Only include your Makefile if its absolutely nessary for you to do something differently
Your code should not print ANYTHING in the terminal
Your output text file should be trace.txt.out
Make sure your code terminates after all entries in the trace.txt are over
